# Ski Report Application
Made by Devyn Duvall, Clayton Novotney, and Gordon Lee

### Over View
This application is aimed at developing a program that is going to take in user feedback and give them the closest resorts in the area tat are most suitiable to go skiing at. This process will take in various elements to come up with a list of resorts in the area with their given rating. The reason for doing this is to develop a streamlined process for skiers and boarders to find the best conditions. Before, people would have to scower the internet for information but now they will no longer need to do that because all of the information will be up on this application.

### Process
We are first going to use the World Weather Online API for the basis of all of the weather data for the ski resorts. The reason for us using this API key is because it has all of the information necesary to develop a score for the ski resort that the individual wants to go to.

There will be an option to see the amount of snow fall, temp, wind and various other data types for the day and next which will be represented through a line or bar graphs. These graphs will be able to give a visual represenation of the condition on the hill and be able to be used a comparison to other ski reports. This aspect is key to the user being able to fully understand the forecast and allow them to make the best decision when deciding which mountains to go to.

##### All of the relavent data will be shown in a graph like below:

|              |Mount Baker|Crystal Mountain|Stevens Pass|Snoqualamie|
|--------------|-----------|----------------|------------|-----------|
|Snow Precip   |    -       |     -           |      -      |    -       
|Chance of Snow|    -       |       -         |       -     |      -     
|Wind          |     -      |       -         |   -         |      -     
|Temp          |  -         |     -           |     -       |     -      
|Wind Chill    |      -     |    -            |     -       |       -    
|Visibility    |     -      |     -           |     -       |      -     
|Chance of Rain|     -      |     -           |      -      |      -     
|Chance of Wind|     -      |       -         |       -     |        -   
|Chance of Sun |     -      |       -         |      -      |     -     

### Reason for this Application

Skiers and snowboarders want the best conditions possible while being out on the mountain and this application will allow them to find the most relavent information all at their finger tips. The application will show graphs, able a comparison, and show all of the relevant data needed to find the best mountains in Washington State.

Some other stakeholders that could be seen using this application would be Park Rangers, Search and Rescue or other Emergency Personel. The application is intensive, sifts through a lot of valuable data, and presents in a way that could be understood by just about anyone. This is key to the sucess of this application.

### How it Works

First, you must pick the mountain in which you want to get data from. For instance, lets pick "Mount Baker". You can then click on the sidebar the forecast that you want to see such as: "Wind", "Snow Accumulation", or "Temperature". All of these forecasts will be used by the user to see whether which mountain is best suited for the next day. The data will then be able to be shown on tab 2, named "Conditions", which is where all of the data can be seen for the particular mountain. Some people prefer the visualization while others prefer reading numbers on table, hence why we included both options for users to see the forecast.
